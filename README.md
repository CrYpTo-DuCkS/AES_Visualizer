# AES_Visualizer
A visualizer for one round of AES to make it easier to understand how this cipher works

The visualizer is made in Python using the pygame library. 

To view the visualisation clone the github repo and run the following command:
```
python main.py
```

The visualiser first shows one round of key expansion algorithm to generate the round key and then using this key it shows how a state is encrypted in one round of AES.
